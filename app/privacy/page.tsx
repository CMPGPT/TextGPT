          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Payment Information:</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When you purchase a subscription, we use a third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle the transaction securely. We collect information necessary to process your payment, such as your billing address and payment method details (e.g., credit card number, expiration date â€“ processed directly by the payment processor). We receive confirmation of payment, subscription status, and potentially masked payment details (e.g., last four digits of a card) from the processor. We do not directly store your full sensitive payment card information on our servers.
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Usage and Interaction Data:</p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            We use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to operate and secure the Service, manage sessions, remember preferences, understand user activity, and improve user experience. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-textgpt-300">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">We use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-textgpt-300">4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We do not sell your Personal Information. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Telecommunication Partners:</strong> We share necessary information (such as account identifiers and potentially associated phone numbers) with our underlying telecommunication partners solely for the purpose of provisioning, managing, and enabling texting functionality for your virtual eSIM.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Service Providers:</strong> To provide the AI-powered response feature, the content of text messages sent to your eSIM is shared temporarily with our third-party AI technology providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar). We have contractual agreements with these providers requiring them to:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>Use the message content only for the purpose of generating the AI response back to our Service for delivery.</li>
                <li>Maintain the confidentiality and security of the data.</li>
                <li>Not use your message content for training their general AI models or for any other purpose, unless explicitly required for service provision under strict confidentiality or if data is fully anonymized according to industry standards.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> We share necessary transaction information with our third-party payment processors to securely handle your subscription payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party vendors performing services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, data storage, analytics, customer support platforms, email delivery). These providers are contractually bound to protect your information and use it only for the services they provide to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements and Law Enforcement:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, court order, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, respond to a government request, or comply with regulatory requirements (especially in telecommunications).</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to standard confidentiality agreements.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information for other purposes if we have obtained your explicit consent to do so.</li>
            <li><strong>IQRCodes Business Reporting (Aggregated Data):</strong> For IQRCodes business users, we may provide aggregated and anonymized reports regarding QR code usage (e.g., number of scans), but we will not share individual consumer phone numbers or specific message content with the business user through these standard reports.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-textgpt-300">5. AI Processing and Message Content</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The core functionality of TextGPT & IQRCodes relies on processing text message content using AI. We understand the sensitivity of this data:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Purpose Limitation:</strong> Message content is processed solely to understand the context and generate an appropriate AI reply as configured by you (or the business user in IQRCodes).</li>
            <li><strong>Transience:</strong> While message content must be processed by the AI, we strive to minimize its retention. It is processed transiently for response generation. Associated metadata and interaction logs (without full message content where feasible) may be retained longer for service operation, billing, and troubleshooting as described in Section 7.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> We implement technical and organizational measures to protect the confidentiality of message content during processing. Access is strictly limited.</li>
            <li><strong>No Training (Default):</strong> By default, your specific message content is not used to train general AI models by us or our third-party AI providers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-textgpt-300">6. Data Security</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. These include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Encryption of data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.</li>
            <li>Access controls and authentication mechanisms.</li>
            <li>Regular security assessments and updates.</li>
            <li>Secure handling of payment information via PCI-compliant processors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6">
            However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are also responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-textgpt-300">7. Data Retention</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Retained while your account is active and for a reasonable period afterward for administrative purposes, dispute resolution, or as required by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment and Subscription Data:</strong> Retained as necessary for billing, accounting, and compliance requirements.</li>

            <li><strong>AI Processed Message Content:</strong> Retained only transiently as needed for immediate AI response generation. Logs of interactions (potentially excluding full sensitive content) may be kept longer.</li>
            <li><strong>Verification Information:</strong> Retained as long as necessary for compliance and account validation purposes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6">
            When information is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it.
          </p>
